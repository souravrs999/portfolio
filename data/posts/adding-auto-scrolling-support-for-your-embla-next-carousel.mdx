## What is an Auto advancing/scrolling Carousel?

An auto advancing carousel unlike a normal carousel cycle's throught it's content without any manual interaction from the user,
they are mainly used to improve the visibility for a particular items or product. These type of carousels usually cycles through
each of its content usually after a fixed amount of time.

## Usability Issues

If you are planning to use and auto advancing/scrolling carousel in your website/application there are some key usability Issues
that you must take into account:
1. You should make sure that the user have control over the carousel interface no matter the type of carousel you are planning to use.
2. Do not try to populate your carousel with more than what's required user's might not stick around to view the entireity of your carousel
   so make sure you only have few necessary slides.
3. Make sure your UI elements stays in the carousel viewport for atleat 4-5 seconds else it might flash away even before the user can properly
   interact with them.
4. The UI elements or products that are present on the carousel slides should have more importance compared to others and should be used to
   draw in the users to it.

## Getting started

With everythin out of the way let's get started by building our auto advancing/sliding carousel, we will be using Embla Carousel for this purpose.

We will be reusing the Embla Carousel component in the starting of this series and the add the auto scrolling to it, If you havent read about how
to setup an Embla Carousel component please follow the step's available [Here](/blogs/adding-embla-carousel-to-nextjs-application)

Once you have done that you now have a basic Embla Carousel component with navigation dots.

Let's start with creating a _recursiveTimeout.js_ file near your Carousel component and add this to it.

<CodeBlock>
```JavaScript:recursiveTimeout.js
import { useCallback, useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

function RecursiveTimeout(callback, delay) {
  // we use this state to check if our carousel in running or not
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(false);

  // we will use stop and play methods as a way to control our
  // carousel's animation states to start and stop animating it.
  const stop = useCallback(() => setIsRunning(false), [setIsRunning]);
  const play = useCallback(() => setIsRunning(true), [setIsRunning]);
  const savedCallback = useRef(callback);

  useEffect(() => {
    savedCallback.current = callback;
  }, [callback]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isRunning) return;
    let id = 0;

    function tick() {

      // if our carousel is not running then use the clearTimeout()
      // method to cancel the setTimeout() method we might have used.
      if (!isRunning) return clearTimeout(id);
      savedCallback.current();
      requestAnimationFrame(() => (id = setTimeout(tick, delay)));
    }

    // else start an animation with a timeout delay of { delay }
    requestAnimationFrame(() => (id = setTimeout(tick, delay)));

    return () => {
      if (id) clearTimeout(id);
      stop();
    };
  }, [isRunning, delay, stop]);

  // return our play or stop method which we can call from
  // our parent element.
  return { play, delay, stop };
}

export default RecursiveTimeout;
```
</CodeBlock>

Now continuing from where we left off in our previous article about [adding
Embla Carousel to your NextJS application](/blogs/adding-embla-carousel-to-nextjs-application)
your index.jsx file should look like this.

<CodeBlock>
```JavaScript:index.js
import Image from "next/image";
import { useEmblaCarousel } from "embla-carousel/react";
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from "react";
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Hero(props) {

  const [emblaRef, embla] = useEmblaCarousel({
    align: "start",
    loop: true,
    skipSnaps: false,
    inViewThreshold: 0.7,
  });

  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);
  const [scrollSnaps, setScrollSnaps] = useState([]);

  const scrollTo = useCallback(
    (index) => embla && embla.scrollTo(index),
    [embla]
  );

  const onSelect = useCallback(() => {
    if (!embla) return;
    setSelectedIndex(embla.selectedScrollSnap());
  }, [embla, setSelectedIndex]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!embla) return;
    onSelect();
    setScrollSnaps(embla.scrollSnapList());
    embla.on("select", onSelect);
  }, [embla, setScrollSnaps, onSelect]);

  return (...)

}
```
</CodeBlock>

Now let's import the recursiveTimeout function that we've just created in our _recursiveTimeout.js_ file to our
_index.jsx_ file and create an _autoplay_ function.

<CodeBlock>
```JavaScript:index.js
import Image from "next/image";
import { useEmblaCarousel } from "embla-carousel/react";
import { useState, useEffect, useCallback } from "react";
import Link from "next/link";

// let's import recursiveTimeout and
// create an interval for changing slides
import RecursiveTimeout from './recursiveTimeout';

const AUTOPLAY_INTERVAL = 4000; // 4 seconds

export default function Hero(props) {

  const [emblaRef, embla] = useEmblaCarousel({
    align: "start",
    loop: true,
    skipSnaps: false,
    inViewThreshold: 0.7,
  });

  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(0);
  const [scrollSnaps, setScrollSnaps] = useState([]);

  // create an autoplay function and pass it in along with the delay
  // to RecursiveTimeout funtion.
  const autoplay = useCallback(() => {
    if (!embla) return;

    // check if we can scroll to next slide if yes then call scrollNext() method
    // else scroll to the first element this is useful when you have a fixed number
    // of slides and wont work if you have loop set to true.
    if (embla.canScrollNext()) {
      embla.scrollNext();
    } else {
      embla.scrollTo(0);
    }
  }, [embla]);

  // returns the play and stop methods
  const { play, stop } = RecursiveTimeout(autoplay, AUTOPLAY_INTERVAL);

  const scrollTo = useCallback(
    (index) => embla && embla.scrollTo(index),
    stop()  // we can use the stop method to prevent the carousel
    // from further animating if the user clicks on a praticular navigation
    // dot.
    [embla, stop()]
  );

  const onSelect = useCallback(() => {
    if (!embla) return;
    setSelectedIndex(embla.selectedScrollSnap());
  }, [embla, setSelectedIndex]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!embla) return;
    onSelect();
    setScrollSnaps(embla.scrollSnapList());
    embla.on("select", onSelect);
  }, [embla, setScrollSnaps, onSelect]);

  // use the useEffect hook to start animating the carousel
  // once it has been successfully mounted
  useEffect(() => {
    play();
  }, [play]);

  return (...)
}
```
</CodeBlock>

And now we have a perfectly self advancing/scrolling carousel for our NextJS website/application.

<BlogImg

  width={800}
  height={338}
  alt="Auto advancing/scrolling carousel with Embla Carousel."

<QuotedText>
  Note : If you're using a self advancing/scrolling Carousel in your
  website/application you should make sure that it dosen't interfere with the
  user experience like scrolling to a different slide if the user tries to click
  on a particular slide.
</QuotedText>

To fix the above mentioned issue we can use _onMouseOver_ and _onMouseLeave_ events
to stop the scrolling animation of the Carousel if the user move's his mouse over the
Carousel viewport and restart the animation when the mouse leave's the viewport.

To do this let's add these events to our _index.jsx_ file.

<CodeBlock>
```JavaScript:index.js
// Carousel container with ref
<div className="overflow-hidden" ref={emblaRef}>
    {/* Carousel viewport */}
    {/* Call the stop method when the users mouse is over the viewport
    and call the play method once it leaves the viewport */}
    <div className="flex" onMouseOver={stop} onMouseLeave={play}>
        {_tposts.map((post) => (
            {/* Carousel slide component */}
            <div
              className="flex relative flex-wrap flex-none mx-10 w-full lg:flex-nowrap"
              key={slide.id}
            >
            {...}
            </div>
        ))}
    </div>
</div>
```
</CodeBlock>

And that's it we have successfully created a Carousel and added auto advancing/scrolling capability to it.
