## Why Typescript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a strongly typed programming language which builds on JavaScript
giving you better tooling at any scale. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are
also valid TypeScript programs.

## Ease of Use

One of the big benefits of TypeScript is that it enables IDE's to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors
as you type the code.

For a large JavaScript project, adopting TypeScript might result in more robust software, while still being deployable where
a regular JavaScript application would run.

It is open source, and you get the clever intellisense as you type if you use a supported IDE like Microsoft's
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

NextJS provides an integrated TypeScript experience out of the box which makes our life's much easier.

## Installation

Let's begin by opening your Terminal and running the following command

<CodeBlock>
```bash:Terminal
npx create-next-app next-typescript-example && cd next-typescript-example
```
</CodeBlock>

this will create a new NextJS project directory named _next-typescript-example_ and change to that directory.

Create a new _tsconfig.json_ file in the root of your directory.

<CodeBlock>
```bash:Terminal
touch tsconfig.json
```
</CodeBlock>

Now, try restarting the developement server (_npm run dev_ or _yarn dev_). It
should spit out some warnings like so.

<CodeBlock>
```bash:Terminal
# It looks like you're trying to use TypeScript but do not have the required
# package(s) installed.

# Please install typescript, @types/react, and @types/node by running:

# yarn add --dev typescript @types/react @types/node
```
</CodeBlock>

this is because we have not installed TypeScript or its accompnying types for our project, so lets
go ahead and install them.

<CodeBlock>
```bash:Terminal
# If you're using npm
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node

# If you're using yarn
yarn add --dev typescript @types/react @types/node
```
</CodeBlock>

Now restart the development server again, NextJS will automaticall populate the _tsconfig.json_ file and have created the _next-env.d.ts_
files, try not to change anything within this file, now you've added Typescript to your NextJS app.

Now let's rename the files to _ts_ and _tsx_ files, a _.tsx_ files is a TypeScript file written using JSX syntax.
Try to be consistent with naming of the files in your project although a _.ts_ file may export a TSX Component it is not
considered as a good convention to do so and might create confusions with your collegues when you are working in a major Project.

<CodeBlock>
```bash:Editor
pages/api/*.js      --> pages/api/*.ts
pages/_app.js       --> pages/_app.tsx
pages/index.js      --> pages/index.tsx
pages/_document.js  --> pages/_document.tsx
```
</CodeBlock>

with that done go to your _pages/\_app.ts_ file and use the built-in type _AppProps_, like so:

<CodeBlock>
```TypeScript:_app.ts
import { AppProps } from 'next/app'

function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default App
```
</CodeBlock>

with that we've converted our JavaScript NextJS app to a TypeScript one. here are some most commonly used NextJS specific types
that you will run into.

**Data Fetching Methods**

_getStaticProps_, _getStaticPaths_, _getServerSideProps_ types:

<CodeBlock>
```TypeScript:index.tsx
import { GetStaticProps, GetStaticPaths, GetServerSideProps } from 'next'

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async context => {
  // ...
}

export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
  // ...
}

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async context => {
  // ...
}
```
</CodeBlock>

**API Routes**

_Request_, _Response_ types:

<CodeBlock>
```TypeScript:
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'

export default (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  // ...
}
```
</CodeBlock>

That's it! Your app is now powered by Typescript. you can learn more about using NextJS in TypesScript by referring to NextJS official [TypeScript documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript).
